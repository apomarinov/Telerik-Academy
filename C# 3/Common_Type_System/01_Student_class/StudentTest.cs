// Problem 1
// Define a class Student, which contains data about a student â€“ first, middle and last name, SSN, permanent address, 
// mobile phone e-mail, course, specialty, university, faculty. Use an enumeration for the specialties, universities and faculties.
// Override the standard methods, inherited by System.Object: Equals(), ToString(), GetHashCode() and operators == and !=.

// Problem 2
// Add implementations of the ICloneable interface. The Clone() method should deeply copy all object's fields into a new object of type Student.

// Problem 3
// Implement the IComparable<Student> interface to compare students by names (as first criteria, in lexicographic order)
// and by social security number (as second criteria, in increasing order).
